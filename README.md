**ADVANCED Project: Final Task - User Authentication System**

## Description

The User Authentication System is an advanced-level cybersecurity project designed to showcase your skills in creating secure and efficient authentication mechanisms. This project is essential for any cybersecurity portfolio and demonstrates proficiency in protecting user data and ensuring secure access to systems.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create accounts with secure password handling.
- **Login System**: Authenticates users with encrypted credentials.
- **Password Recovery**: Provides mechanisms for users to recover or reset their passwords.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implements different user roles with varied access permissions.
- **Security Enhancements**: Incorporates best practices for securing user data and preventing common vulnerabilities.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main application script implementing the authentication system.
- `models.py`: Contains database models for user accounts and roles.
- `routes.py`: Defines routes and handlers for user authentication operations.
- `static/`: Directory containing CSS, JavaScript, and other static files.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for user interactions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Required Python Packages**: List of Python packages needed for this project.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

In your terminal or command prompt, execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/slash-mark-final.git
cd slash-mark-final
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Database

Ensure that you have a database set up for user data. Configure your database settings in `config.py` or directly within `app.py` as per your setup.

### 5. Initialize the Database

Run the following command to initialize the database with required tables:

```bash
python app.py initdb
```

## Usage

### 1. Run the Application

Start the application by executing:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5000` (or the specified port).

### 2. Register a New User

Navigate to the registration page and fill out the form to create a new account.

### 3. Log In

Use the login page to authenticate with your registered credentials.

### 4. Password Recovery

If you forget your password, use the password recovery feature to reset it.

## Example Workflow

1. **Register a User**

   Access the registration page and input your details:
   
   ```plaintext
   Username: hacker
   Email: hacker@example.com
   Password: securepassword123
   ```

2. **Login**

   Access the login page and authenticate:
   
   ```plaintext
   Username: hacker
   Password: securepassword123
   ```

3. **Password Recovery**

   If you forget your password, follow the instructions on the password recovery page to reset it.

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependencies Issues**: Ensure all required Python packages are installed and up-to-date.
- **Database Errors**: Verify that the database configuration is correct and the database is accessible.
- **Application Errors**: Check the application logs for detailed error messages and consult the documentation for potential solutions.

## Notes

- **Security**: This project demonstrates best practices in securing user authentication. Regularly update and patch any dependencies to maintain security.
- **Customizations**: Feel free to modify and extend the authentication system to meet specific requirements or integrate with other systems.
